# airtame-cli

airtame-cli is a command line interface to the AIRTAME core streaming software. It communicates with the **streamer** program that runs on the same machine and allows the user to connect the PC to an AIRTAME device.

## Run
1. Make sure the airtame-streamer is running.
2. airtame-cli init
3. airtame-cli connect [host-or-ip]

Run airtame-cli --help for more information.

## Author's Note
I hacked this up because I didn't like the temporary solution provided by Airtame. Feel free to contribute improvements!
